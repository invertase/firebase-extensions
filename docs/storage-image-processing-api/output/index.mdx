# Output

A `mandatory` operation when requesting an image.

This provides the format of the generated image along with additional (optional) transformations.

## Format

This mandatory and dictates which optional output operations can be applied.

This must be one of the following...

- [jpeg](/storage-image-processing-api/output/jpeg)
- [webp](/storage-image-processing-api/output/webp)
- [tiff](/storage-image-processing-api/output/tiff)
- [avif](/storage-image-processing-api/output/avif)
- [png](/storage-image-processing-api/output/png)

This can be added at their end of the process url as `/output~format:png`.
