# Getting started

## Installation

This extension requires a `STORAGE_BUCKET`, this is the location where the processed images are saved and accessed.

## Generating an image

This extension allows multiple chaining of operations within a url allow multiple transformations to be parsed and applied to the image to be processed.

This url can be broken down into the following parts.

{`domain`}?{`input`}/{`operations`}/{`output`}

`domain`

This is the location of your installed cloud function, this is defined by the deployed function name and the location where the extension has been installed.

For example `http://localhost:5001`/extensions-testing/`europe-west2`/api/process/

`input`

Input is a mandatory operation, this is the image source and will need to include a type.

A full list of options can be found [here](/input)

`Operations`

Operations are `(optional)` key transformations that can take place on image.

A full list of options can be found [here](/operations)

`Output`

Output is a `mandatory` option which contains at least one output operation. A full list can be found [here](https://todo-output-ops-link)

A full list of options can be found [here](/output)

## Understanding operations

As a url can be broken down into the above sections. Each input, operation and output can contain multiple elements. This allows multiple transformation to be applied simultaneously.

### Parsing

Operations are parsed on the following characters: `/` `:` `~`.

This can be broken down as `/`operation`~`property`:`value`~`property`:`value`/`

## Example: Single Operation

/resize~width:100~height:100/

This would parse `resize` as the operations and apply the `height` and `width` properties to 100 pixels.

## Example: Multiple operations

Building upon the previous example, we can now add an additional operation. In this example we add a grayscale operation.

/resize~width:100~height:100/grayscale~grayscale:true
