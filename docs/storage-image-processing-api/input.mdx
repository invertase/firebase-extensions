# Input

The input operation specifies what image will be used as the source of the image processing. This can either be a path to a file on your storage bucket,
a remote URL, or allow the extension to create an image on the fly.

## Google Cloud Storage

This is a valid google cloud storage url of an existing image. For example:

```json
{ "operation": "input", "type": "gcs", "source": "gs://bucket/path/to/file" }
```

## URL

A generic url of an existing image. For example:

```json
{ "operation": "input", "type": "url", "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg" }
```

## Create

This has no source and will generate an image based on the operations provided. For example:

```json
{ "operation": "input", "type": "create" }
```
