**Description**: Use this extension to optimize and transform images via a powerful HTTP API with over 30 different image operations to enhance and manipulate your images.

**Details**: Use this extension to optimize and transform images via a powerful HTTP API with over 30 different image operations to enhance and manipulate your images.

This extension creates a Cloud Function named `process`, which can be called via a GET request, specifiying
the operations to perform via the `operations` query parameter, for example:

```js
const operations = [
  {
    operation: 'input',
    type: 'url',
    url: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1663659552548-25d7771802c9?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80',
  },
  {
    operation: 'grayscale',
  },
  {
    operation: 'output',
    format: 'webp',
  },
];

const params = `?operations=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(operations))}`;
```

#### Additional setup

Before installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Storage bucket](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) in your Firebase project.

#### Billing

To install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)

- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).
- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the serviceâ€™s no-cost tier:
  - Cloud Storage
  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))

**Configuration Parameters:**

- Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your Storage bucket. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).

- Cloud Storage bucket for images: The Cloud Storage bucket where images that are to be processed are located. API requests with input urls or paths that are not inside this bucket will be dropped.

- Allowed CORS origins.: A comma delimited value of allowed CORS origins. Use the default of '\*' to allow all origins. This is useful to lockdown your API and only allow your own website to embed the images directly. Note this will not prevent non-browser requests from accessing your API.

**Cloud Functions:**

- **handler:** Serves a API accepting incoming HTTP requests.

**APIs Used**:

- storage-component.googleapis.com (Reason: Needed to use Cloud Storage)

**Access Required**:

This extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:

- storage.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to read images in Cloud Storage)
