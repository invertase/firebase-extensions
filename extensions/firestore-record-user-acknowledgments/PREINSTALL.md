This extension makes it easy to add notices to your application that your users can acknowledge. The extension helps with:

- Storing/retrieving notices with versioning built in
- Marking notices with an acknowledgment type (including notice ID/version/timestamp recorded)
- Retrieving a historical log of which users have acknowledged which notices
- Collecting custom acknowledgment metadata (such as additional user preferences) for a notice
- Allowing notices to be only acknowledged by a select group of users

You can see this extension in use on the [Kara’s Coffee demo application](https://karas-coffee.web.app/), or [view the source code](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/karas-coffee).
