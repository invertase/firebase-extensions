# Record User Acknowledgements

**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)

**Description**: Provides an out of the box acknowledgement management extension for Firestore

**Details**: This extension makes it easy to add notices to your application that your users can acknowledge. The extension helps with:

- Storing/retrieving notices with versioning built in
- Marking notices with an acknowledgement type (including notice ID/version/timestamp recorded)
- Retrieving a historical log of which users have acknowledged which notices
- Collecting custom acknowledgement metadata (such as additional user preferences) for a notice
- Allowing notices to be only acknowledged by a select group of users

You can see this extension in use on the [Kara’s Coffee demo application](https://karas-coffee.web.app/), or [view the source code](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/karas-coffee).

#### Additional setup

Also, make sure that you've set up [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to manage your users. All acknowledgement records in Firestore created by this extension are associated with a Firebase Auth UID.
