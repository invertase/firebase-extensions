Use this extension to optimize and transform images via a powerful HTTP API with over 30 different image operations to enhance and manipulate your images.

This extension creates a Cloud Function named `process`, which can be called via a GET request, specifiying
the operations to perform via the `operations` query parameter, for example:

```js
const operations = [
  {
    operation: 'input',
    type: 'url',
    url: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  },
  {
    operation: 'grayscale',
  },
  {
    operation: 'output',
    format: 'webp',
  },
];

const params = `?operations=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(operations))}`;
```
