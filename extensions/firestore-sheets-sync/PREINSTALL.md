Use this extension to sync Firestore documents to Google Sheets automatically.

This extension creates a Cloud Function named `googleSheetSync`, which will be triggered when a Firestore document is created in the specified collection.

#### Pre-requisites

You must create a Google Sheets document that you want to sync with Firestore.
The Google Sheet ID can be found in the URL of the document, for example:

```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DDMVqIN4lasb8y2EEVQyTKrlcLPZVLpqHyK26P9VtdU/
```

The ID is the part after `/d/` and before the next `/`.
